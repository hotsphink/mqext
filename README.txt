Modify Mercurial's MQ extension by altering several commands and adding a few more. Install it by pointing your ~/.hgrc at it, eg:

  [extensions]
  mq =
  mqext = ~/lib/hg/mqext

Commands added:
  qshow - Display a single patch (similar to 'export')
  qexport - Write all patches to an output directory, with minor renaming
  qtouched - See what patches modify which files

The following commands are modified to add options that autocommit any
changes made to your patch queue to the queue repository
(a la hg commit --mq):
  qrefresh
  qnew
  qrename
  qdelete
The expected usage is to add the -Q option to all relevant commands in your
~/.hgrc so that all changes are autocommitted:

  [defaults]
  qnew = -Q
  qrefresh = -Q
  qrename = -Q
  qdelete = -Q

Commands not related to mq:
  lineage - Dump out the revision history leading up to a particular revision
